## Heart Disease Prediction(ML Algorithms) - Python 
<hr >

#### This project predicts heart disease using machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, KNN, and SVM. Implemented through a user-friendly GUI, the models are trained on a Kaggle dataset, with thorough data cleaning and preprocessing. The results are presented with clear visualizations, and the project includes comprehensive model evaluation and considerations for future enhancements.
